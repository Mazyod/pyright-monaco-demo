## About this Fork

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This fork of Pyright Playground is focused on demonstrating the Pyright - Monaco Editor integration by reducing the code, reorganizing it to reusable parts, and supporting additional features.
>
> You should essentially be able to copy/paste the `LspMonaco` directory and with relative ease integrated them with your own projects.

> [!TIP]
> For an example of how to run Pyright directly on the browser, check out the [BasedPyright Playground](https://github.com/DetachHead/basedpyright-playground/) repository.

```typescript
const monacoLsp = useMonacoLsp({
  initialCode: initialState.code,
  settings: lspSettings,
  apiAddressPrefix: "...",
});
```
